## Code
4C is written in modern c++ language, and it is open-source code, which can be found on [Github](https://www.github.com).
It leverages the Trilinos library

## Docmentation

Documentation of the code is available for both developers and users. 
The [Doxygen site](https://baci.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/baci/doxygen/index.html) is of course rather intended for programmers, 
while users might be more interested in the [user documentation](https://baci.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/baci/readthedocs/index.html), which is written in a readthedocs style.
It contains a input file reference, tutorials and an extending part of simulation details and hints.

The development of 4C arose from the need to tackle challenging research questions in and with numerical methods 
for ordinary and partial differential equations and to advance complex models for real-world applications, 
all based on a proper theoretical foundation and with verified and state-of-the-art methods and software implementations. 
Since suitable tools are often not available either in commercial or in other (academic) research codes, 
we want to close this gap by developing 4C, a comprehensive multiphysics simulation framework. 

4C originated in the 2000s at the Institute for Computational Mechanics of the Technical University of Munich, 
where the software has been developed under the name BACI. 
This has been built upon the extensive experience of individual developers of the software ccarat 
of the Institute for Structural Mechanics of the University of Stuttgart.

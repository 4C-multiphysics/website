  abstract = {In this thesis, computational multiscale methods for turbulent single and two-phase flows are considered. For large-eddy simulation of turbulent single-phase incompressible flow, a novel approach based on multifractal subgrid-scale modeling is developed. Two-phase flows, where the interface separating the two fluids appears as a discontinuity in the flow field, are tackled by an extendend finite element method. The combined approach is applied to large-eddy simulation of turbulent two-phase flow.},

  abstract = {This work is on the development of a finite deformation frictional contact formulation including wear and thermal coupling. It is based on the finite element method. For contact surface discretization, the mortar method is chosen and yields perfect results even for non-matching meshes. Dual Lagrange multipliers are used for an exact and computationally cheap enforcement of contact constraints. The semi-smooth Newton method in combination with a consistent linearization allows for an efficient solution of the highly nonlinear problem. The inclusion of wear is realized with both an internal state variable approach and an Arbitrary Lagrangean-Eulerian formulation, where the latter enables the modeling of significant material loss. The multiphysics problem of thermomechanical contact is obtained by adding a thermal field. Coupling effects are resolved efficiently with a partitioned and a monolithic scheme.},

A novel monolithic fluid-structure interaction approach that allows for large rotations of the structure  realizes the coupling of the membrane to the cytosol and to the blood plasma.

The structure can move independently of a spatially fixed fluid mesh such that an arbitrary structure deformation is possible. The Eulerian fluid formulation is extended in two steps: First, fluid regions with overlapping  fluid and structure mesh are decoupled from the physical flow by discontinuous finite element shape functions. Second, the physical flow on the fixed grid is coupled with the structure surface using a new parameter-free, weighted-residual based formulation. The resulting fixed-grid formulation is integrated into an parallel multiphysics software. The description of the structure movement by the Lagrangian formulation allows the use of established, monolithic and partitioned FSI approaches. The accuracy and versatility of the presented method is demonstrated by three-dimensional examples.},

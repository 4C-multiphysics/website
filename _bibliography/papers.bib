problems using monolithic schemes. The proposed preconditioners form an unified framework that can
be implemented for any generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary number of fields, and be
used to solve a large variety of applications. The preconditioners presented here are obtained by
generalizing promising application-specific techniques presented pre- viously in the literature.
The first one is based on a generic block Gauss-Seidel iteration for uncoupling the fields, and
standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second
preconditioner is based on the SIMPLE method which is extended here to deal with an arbitrary
number of fields, which also results in uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG.
Finally, a more sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all AMG
levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling only at the finest
level. The versatility of the preconditioners is demonstrated considering three very different
coupled problems: thermo-structure interaction, fluid-structure interaction and a complex model of
the human lung. Numerical results show that the general purpose methods are efficient and scalable
in a wide range of applications.",

system against the background of acute lung diseases and mechanical ventilation.
Conceptually, we divide the lung into two major subsystems, namely the
conducting airways and the respiratory zone. Due to their respective complexity,
both parts are out of range for a simulation resolving all relevant length scales.
Therefore, we develop novel multi-scale approaches taking into account the unresolved
parts appropriately. In the respiratory zone, an alveolar ensemble is modelled
considering not only tissue behaviour but also the influence of the covering surfactant
film. On the global scale, a homogenised parenchyma model is derived from
experiments on living lung tissue. At certain hotspots, novel nested multi-scale procedures
are utilised to simulate the dynamic behaviour of lung parenchyma as a
whole while still resolving alveolar scales locally. In the tracheo-bronchial region,
CT-based geometries are employed in fluid-structure interaction simulations. Physiological
outflow boundary conditions are derived by considering the impedance of
the unresolved parts of the lung in a fully coupled 3D-0D procedure. Finally, a novel
coupling approach enables the connection of 3D parenchyma and airway models into
one overall lung model for the first time."

This is why strong coupling and even monolithic schemes got considerable attention, even though most of those schemes violate the field solver decoupling. Monolithic schemes based on a block preconditioned Newton-Krylov method are discussed. Finally, the limits imposed by an ALE description of the fluid domain are addressed and an XFEM based fixed-grid is presented as an interesting alternative. Thin-walled structures - the topic of this book - are only rarely explicitly mentioned in this paper. However many challenges described and solved herein are especially pronounced when FSI involves thin-walled structures with large deformations.",

Interestingly, an increased glucose metabolism in AAA wall was strongly associated with rapid progression or acute symptoms and therefore increased rupture risk. Moreover, the PET signal was correlated with histopathological changes such as activation of MMP-9, collagen, and elastic fibers as well as macrophage infiltration in the AAA wall. (It is well documented by preclinical studies that increased activity of MMP9 facilitates aneurysm rupture). However, the true prognostic value of increased FDG uptake for AAA progression and rupture risk still remains uncertain. To provide clear evidence, surveillance of small AAA by multiple PET scans would be necessary over a long period. However, PET studies are not routinely performed in patients with AAA for practical and ethical reasons and therefore an increase in glucose metabolism in AAA wall was not directly observed until now. Further, it is not clear weather biomechanical conditions of AAA such as peak wall stress or wall displacement are relevant for FDG uptake. In this report, we describe a patient with a malignant melanoma with coincident and initially small infrarenal AAA who was examined by PET/computed tomography (CT) for staging and follow-up. During surveillance, the AAA showed rapid progression associated with strongly increased glucose metabolism. The AAA was repaired and histopathological as well as computed biomechanical properties were analyzed.",

We propose two preconditioners that apply algebraic multigrid techniques to the entire fluidstructure interaction system of equations. The first is based on a standard block Gauss Seidel approach where approximate inverses of the individual field blocks are based on an algebraic multigrid hierarchy tailored for the type of the underlying physical problem. The second is based on a monolithic coarsening scheme for the coupled system that makes use of prolongation and restriction projections constructed for the individual fields. The resulting nonsymmetric monolithic algebraic multigrid method therefore involves coupling of the fields on coarse approximations to the problem yielding significantly enhanced performance.",

The structural and thermal fields are independently discretised. For the monolithic TSI
scheme, an iterative solver (generalised minimal residual method) and an algebraicmultigrid-
based preconditioner are used, based on a Block-Gauss-Seidel approach. The
proposed method is tested for the second Danilovskaya problem, and good agreement
of the numerical results with results from the literature is observed. Furthermore, it is
shown that the monolithic algorithm exhibits improved stability compared to fully-coupled
partitioned algorithms. This novel computational method is developed for enabling improved
designs of rocket nozzles for the application in overexpansion (on ground) and
underexpansion (in vacuum) as well as against internal (pressure or temperature) and
external loads (buffeting or booster radiation)."

schemes require good preconditioning to be efficient. We propose two preconditioners that apply
algebraic multigrid techniques to the entire fluid-structure interaction system of equations. The first
is based on a standard block Gauss-Seidel approach where approximate inverses of the individual field
blocks are based on a algebraic multigrid hierarchy tailored for the type of the underlying physical
problem. The second is based on a monolithic coarsening scheme for the coupled system that makes
use of prolongation and restriction projections constructed for the individual fields. The resulting
nonsymmetric monolithic algebraic multigrid method therefore involves coupling of the fields on
coarse approximations to the problem yielding significantly enhanced performance.",

  abstract = "It is apparent that physics and numerics are strongly linked in every serious undertaking in computational
mechanics. This is in particular pronounced when the matter of study excels through a very
sophisticated, even sometimes tricky physical behaviour. Such a delicate characteristic is the trademark
of shell structures, which are the most often used structural components in nature and technology.
This outstanding position in the hierarchy of all structures is due to their curvature allowing to carry
transverse loading in an optimal way by in-plane membrane actions, despite an often extreme slenderness.
As typical for optimized systems their performance might be on the one hand excellent, but
can also be extremely sensitive to certain parameter changes on the other hand. This prima donna like
mechanical behaviour with all its sensitivities is of course carried over to any numerical scheme. In
other words it is a fundamental precondition to understand the principle features of the load carrying
mechanisms of shells before designing and applying any numerical formulation.
The present study addresses this peculiar interrelation between physics and numerics. At first
typical characteristics of shell structures are described; this include their benefits but also their
extreme sensitivities. In the second part these aspects are reflected on related computational models
and numerical procedures. This discussion is carried through a number of selected problems and
examples.
It need to be said that the paper is the outcome of a general plenary lecture addressing fundamental
aspects rather than concentrating on a specific formulation or numerical scheme.",

  abstract = "Mechanical ventilation is not only a life saving treatment but can also cause negative side effects. One of the main complications is inflammation caused by overstretching of the alveolar tissue. Previously, studies investigated either global strains or looked into which states lead to inflammatory reactions in cell cultures. However, the connection between the global deformation, of a tissue strip or the whole organ, and the strains reaching the single cells lining the alveolar walls is unknown and respective studies are still missing. The main reason for this is most likely the complex, sponge-like alveolar geometry, whose three dimensional details have been unknown until recently. Utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy, we were able to generate real and detailed three-dimensional alveolar geometries on which we have performed finite-element simulations. This allowed us to determine, for the first time, a three-dimensional strain state within the alveolar wall. Briefly, precision-cut lung slices, prepared from isolated rat lungs, were scanned and segmented to provide a three-dimensional geometry. This was then discretized using newly developed tetrahedral elements. The main conclusions of this study are that the local strain in the alveolar wall can reach a multiple of the value of the global strain, for our simulations up to four times as high and that thin structures obviously cause hotspots that are especially at risk of overstretching.",

were found to be less accurate than when a central discretization with (mainly) Smagorinsky dissipation

While providing extremely useful information, these models do also suffer from limitations in being either too complex for detailed mechanical or mechanistic studies, or in being devoid of the full complexity present in vivo (e.g., different cell types and interstitial matrix). Therefore in the present study it was our aim to develop a new model, based on the biaxial stretching of precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Single PCLS were mounted on a thin and flexible carrier membrane of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a bioreactor, and the membrane was stretched by applying varying pressures under static conditions. Distension of the membrane-PCLS construct was modeled via finite element simulation. According to this analysis, lung tissue was stretched by up to 38% in the latitudinal and by up to 44% in the longitudinal direction, resulting in alveolar distension similar to what has been described in intact lungs. Stretch for 5 min led to increased cellular calcium levels. Lung slices were stretched dynamically with a frequency of 15/min for 4 h without causing cell injury {3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test; live/dead straining}.

the growth of the biofilm structure is coupled with the FSI and mass transport through a
multi-scale approach in time. In each hydrodynamic time step, first the non-linear FSI problem
is solved followed by the scalar transport equations, using the information on velocities and
deformations obtained in the FSI step. After a steady state solution is reached, information on
mass fluxes and stresses are passed to the growth model. At this point, the growth is calculated
for a biological time step larger than the hydrodynamic one and based on the mass flux through
the interface and on normal and shear stresses on it. First numerical examples are run with the
purpose of demonstrating the suitability of the proposed growth model to catch the main features

This paper provides a method for the localization of a higher-order interface finite element (FE) mesh in an underlying three-dimensional higher-order FE mesh. Additionally, it demonstrates, how a subtetrahedralization of an intersected element can be obtained, which preserves the possibly curved interface and allows therefore exact numerical integration. The proposed interface algorithm collects initially a set of possibly intersecting elements by comparing their ?eXtended axis-aligned bounding boxes?. The intersection method is applied to a highly reduced number of intersection candidates. The resulting linearized interface is used as input for an elementwise constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization, which computes an appropriate subdivision for each intersected element. The curved interface is recovered from the linearized interface in the last step. The output comprises triangular integration cells representing the interface and tetrahedral integration cells for each intersected element. Application of the interface algorithm currently concentrates on fluid-structure interaction problems on low-order and higher-order FE meshes, which may be composed of any arbitrary element types such as hexahedra, tetrahedra, wedges, etc.. Nevertheless, other XFEM-problems with explicitly given interfaces or discontinuities may be tackled in addition. Multiple structures and interfaces per intersected element can be handled without any additional difficulties.

  abstract = "The present article reviews the variational multiscale method as a framework for the development of computational methods for the simulation of laminar and turbulent flows, with the emphasis placed on incompressible flows. Starting with a variational formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, a separation of the scales of the flow problem into two and three different scale groups, respectively, is shown. The approaches resulting from these two different separations are interpreted against the background of two traditional concepts for the numerical simulation of turbulent flows, namely direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES). It is then focused on a three-scale separation, which explicitly distinguishes large resolved scales, small resolved scales, and unresolved scales. In view of turbulent flow simulations as a LES, the variational multiscale method with three separated scale groups is refered to as a "variational multiscale LES". The two distinguishing features of the variational multiscale LES in comparison to the traditional LES are the replacement of the traditional filter by a variational projection and the restriction of the effect of the unresolved scales to the smaller of the resolved scales. Existing solution strategies for the variational multiscale LES are presented and categorized for various numerical methods. The main focus is on the finite element method (FEM) and the finite volume method (FVM). The inclusion of the effect of the unresolved scales within the multiscale environment via constant-coefficient and dynamic subgrid-scale modeling based on the subgrid viscosity concept is also addressed. Selected numerical examples, a laminar and two turbulent flow situations, illustrate the suitability of the variational multiscale method for the numerical simulation of both states of flow. This article concludes with a view on potential future research directions for the variational multiscale method with respect to problems of fluid mechanics.",

Two different scale-separating operators based on multigrid operators are used for separating large and small resolved scales. Dynamic as well as constant-coefficient-based subgrid-scale modeling are employed in the variational multiscale LES. The results show that the variational multiscale LES with a simple constant-coefficient Smagorinsky model using a projective scale-separating operator yields a very good prediction of most of the crucial flow features. Furthermore, it turns out to be by far the most computationally efficient approach, resulting in a computing time reduction of about 18 the traditional LES with a dynamic Smagorinsky model.

  abstract = "In a subset of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems of incompressible flow and highly deformable structures all popular partitioned approaches fail to work. This also holds for recently quite popular strong coupling approaches based on Dirichlet-Neumann substructuring. This subset can be described as the special case where the fluid domain is entirely enclosed by Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e. prescribed velocities. A vivid simple example would be a balloon with prescribed inflow rate. In such cases the incompressibility of the fluid cannot be satisfied during standard alternating FSI iterations as the deformation of the coupling surface is determined by the structural displacement that usually does not know about the current constraint on the fluid field. By analysing this deficiency of the partitioned algorithm a small augmentation is proposed which allows to overcome the dilemma of incompressibility and fixed boundary velocities by introducing the volume constraint on the structural system of equations. In contrast to the original accelerated strong coupling partitioned method the relaxation which ensures convergence of the iteration over the different fields has now to be performed on the coupling forces rather than on the displacements. In addition two alternative approaches are discussed for the solution of the dilemma. The capability of the proposed method to deal with largely changing volumes of enclosed fluid is demonstrated by means of numerical examples",

problems. Boundary conditions on embedded boundaries are imposed weakly
using a Nitsche type approach. Ghost-penalty terms for velocity and pressure are added
for stability reasons and to improve the conditioning of the system matrix. The idea of
ghost-penalties, previously developed for Stokes problems, is extended to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations by using face-oriented fluid stabilizations for both viscous

boundary conditions for non-viscous flows is addressed. A detailed numerical analysis of
our stabilized fluid formulation, including studies of Nitsche’s parameter and the ghostpenalty
parameter, shows optimal error convergence and a good system conditioning in
the viscous and the convective dominated cases. Compared to other fixed-grid fluid formulations,
our method is much more accurate and less sensitive to the location of the
interface. Regarding the accuracy and the sensitivity with respect to the interface position
a clear improvement could be observed for the viscous and pressure fluxes as well

For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficient?especially in the partitioned coupled case.",

We consider the transport in a seven generation model based on an Euler-Euler approach for particles ranging from 1.5nm to 11nm, ie. in a range considered important for the tracheobronchial region. The results indicate that the deposition of smaller particles are affected more by the non-uniformity of the realistic geometry. In particular we observe spatial variations in wall deposition directly resulting from the complex air flow patterns. Time dependent effects tend to be less significant compared with the geometric effects.",

Material and damage parameters are obtained by fitting the strain energy function to the experimental data obtained by uniaxial tensile tests of freshly harvested AAA wall samples.

In a series of finite element simulations of patient-specific AAAs, serving as numerical examples, we investigate the applicability of the damage model.

example application of the model we simulate the flow and pressure dynamics under spontaneous breathing

model is the ability to provide insight into lung ventilation in the peripheral regions. This is often crucial
because this is where information, specifically for studying diseases and gas exchange, is needed. Thus, the

into the background grid independently of background element edges. Since the embedded fluid domain ends
in the middle of background elements, extended finite element techniques are used to model a sharp separation
between active and inactive regions on the background grid. The active background region is coupled to the
boundary layer mesh using a mixed / hybrid Lagrange multiplier technique as proposed in (Gerstenberger and

the Lagrange multiplier unknowns and the Lagrange multiplier can be completely condensed on the element level.

For anisotropic problems, it is fairly standard to generate small aggregates (used to mimic semi-coarsening) in order to coarsen only in directions of strong coupling. Although beneficial to convergence, this can lead to a prohibitively large number of non-zeros in the standard SA prolongator and the corresponding coarse discretization operator. To avoid this, the new prolongator modifies the standard prolongator by shifting support (non-zeros within a prolongator column) from one aggregate to another to satisfy a specified non-zero pattern. This leads to a sparser operator that can be used effectively within a multigrid V-cycle. The key to this algorithm is that it preserves certain null space interpolation properties that are central to SA for both scalar and systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We present two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments to demonstrate that the new method is competitive with standard SA for scalar problems, and significantly better for problems arising from PDE systems.",

This uniform strain approach adopted here exhibits spurious modes as has been previously reported in the literature. We present a new type of stabilization exploiting the circumstance that the instability in the formulation is related to the isochoric strain energy contribution only and we therefore present a stabilization based on a isochoric?volumetric splitting of the stress tensor. We demonstrate that by stabilizing the isochoric energy contributions only, reintroduction of volumetric locking through the stabilization can be avoided.

This last property makes the imposition of essential boundary conditions in the numerical solution of partial differential equations trivial. The evaluation of the shape functions is not explicit, but it is very efficient and robust. To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first higher order scheme for function approximation from unstructured data in arbitrary dimensions with positive shape functions. As a consequence, the approximants exhibit variation diminishing properties, as well as an excellent behavior in structural vibrations problems as compared with Lagrange finite elements, MLSbased meshfree methods and even B-Spline approximations, as discussed on the basis of numerical experiments. When compared with usual MLS-based second order meshfree methods, the shape functions presented here are much easier to integrate in a Galerkin approach, as illustrated by standard benchmark problems.",

The problem is governed by the sensitive and highly non-linear dynamics of slender structures such as shells and membranes in conjunction with the omnipotent incompressibility condition. The contribution presents a partitioned fluid-structure interaction algorithm based on a second order accurate structural solver employing solid shell elements and an Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian flow formulation. Stabilized finite elements are used on the fluid domain. Selected aspects of the individual constituents and their interaction are discussed; among them is the problem of conditioning for the shell model, the flow solver satisfying the geometric conservation law and the reliability of the fluid formulation in case of small time steps and distorted mesh. In view of the incompressibility condition the coupling of the two partitions is in particular addressed. It is well-known that sequential coupling approaches, often used for their computational efficiency, may fail in certain situations when the incompressible flow interacts with an extremely slender low mass structure. It could be shown by a rigorous analysis that this is due to the so-called artificial added mass effect. This is an inherent instability of such schemes that unfortunately cannot be removed by reducing the time steps size. As a remedy a strongly coupled partitioning algorithm is applied iteratively adjusting the interface conditions; here different dynamically adapted relaxation methods can be utilized to accelerate the convergence of the iteration. The use of a fully converged coarse grid solution of the coupled problem as a predictor to the iteration scheme can significantly accelerate its convergence and increase the efficiency of the whole coupling scheme.

As the RBC membrane comprises a phospholipid bilayer with an intervening protein network, we propose to model the membrane with two distinct layers. The quite complex characteristics of the very thin lipid bilayer are represented by special incompressible solid shell elements and an anisotropic viscoelastic constitutive model. Properties of the protein network are modeled with an isotropic hyperelastic third-order material. The elastic behavior of the model is validated with optical tweezers studies with quasi-static deformations. Employing material parameters consistent with literature, simulation results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Available models in literature neglect either the surface area conservation of the RBC membrane or realistic loading conditions for the optical tweezers experiments. The importance of these modeling assumptions, that are both included in this study, are discussed and their influence quantified. For the simulation of the dynamic motion of RBC the model is extended to incorporate the cytoplasm. This is realized with a monolithic fully coupled fluid-structure interaction simulation, where the fluid is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework. It is shown that both membrane viscosity and cytoplasm viscosity have significant influence on simulation results. Characteristic recovery times and energy dissipation for varying strain rates in dynamic laser trap experiments are calculated for the first time and are found to be comparable with experimental data.",

  abstract = "The analysis of large-scale nonlinear shell problems asks for parallel simulation approaches. One crucial part of effi- cient and well scalable parallel FE-simulations is the solver for the system of equations. Due to the inherent suitability for parallelization one is verymuch directed towards preconditioned iterative solvers. However thin-walled-structures discretized byfinite elements lead to ill-conditioned system matrices and therefore performance of iterative solvers is generallypoor. This situation further deteriorates when the thickness change of the shell is taken into account. A preconditioner for this challenging class of problems is presented combining two approaches in a parallel framework. The first approach is a mechanicallymotivated improvement called scaled director conditioning (SDC) and is able to remove the extra-ill conditioning that appears with three-dimensional shell formulations as compared to formulations that neglect thickness change of the shell. It is introduced at the element level and harmonizes well with the second approach utilizing a multilevel algorithm. Here a hierarchyof coarse grids is generated in a semi-algebraic sense using an aggregation concept. Therebythe complicated and expensive explicit generation of course triangulations can be avoided. The formulation of this combined preconditioning approach is given and the effects on the performance of iterative solvers is demonstrated via numerical examples.",

Operators based on plain aggregation algebraic multigrid provide a projective scale separation, enabling an efficient implementation of the proposed method. The application of the algebraic variational multiscale? multigrid method to turbulent flow in a channel produces results notably closer to reference (direct numerical simulation) results than other state-of-the-art methods both for mean streamwise and root-mean-square velocities.

Both approaches lead to different discrete adjoint equations and, depending on the choice of the stabilization parameters and grid size, may significantly affect the computed control. The effect of the order in which the discretization is applied and the choice of the stabilization parameters are illustrated using two test problems.

We investigate the correlation of these two heterogeneities to distinct ?- actinin concentration regimes and demonstrate their influence on the mechanical properties of cross-linked and bundled actin networks. First, locally embedding stiff bundles into the network strengthens the macroscopic network response. Second, the formation of star-like bundle clusters drastically concentrates material in localized spots and weakens the network elasticity. Such bundle cluster networks exhibit kinetically trapped and thus meta-stable network configurations ? which is contrary to the commonly accepted belief of equilibrated network formations.",

The
interplay between mechanics and FDG-metabolic activity was analyzed in terms of maximum values and the three-dimensional spatial relationship, respectively.
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) data sets of n=18 AAA patients were studied. Maximum FDG-uptake (SUVmax) in the AAA wall varied from 1.32 to 4.60 (average SUVmax 3.31 +-0.87). Maximum wall stresses and strains ranged from 10.0 to 64.0 N/cm2
(38.2 +- 13.8 N/cm2) and from 0.190 to (0.260 .0.222+-0.023), respectively. SUVmax was significantly correlated to maximum wall stress and strain (SUVmax to stress: r=0.71, p = 0.0005; SUVmax to strain: r = 0.66, p = 0.0013). To evaluate the three-dimensional spatial interaction between FDG-uptake and acting wall stress, element-wise correlations were performed. In all but 2 AAAs, positive element-wise correlation of FDG-uptake to wall stress was obtained, with the Pearson’s correlation coefficient ranging from -0.168 to 0.738 (0.372+-0.263).
The results indicate that mechanical stresses are correlated quantitatively and spatially to FDG-uptake in the AAA wall. It is hypothesized that unphysiologically increased loading in the AAA wall triggers biological tissue reaction, such as inflammation or regenerative processes, causing elevated FDG-metabolic
activity. These findings strongly support experimental hypotheses of mechanotransduction mechanisms

A level-set or G-function is used to define the flame interface separating the burned from the unburned gases.

  abstract = "This paper presents an improved identification method of the constitutive properties of lung parenchyma. We aim to determine the non-linear viscoelastic behavior of lung
parenchyma with a particular focus on the compressible properties - i.e. the ability to
change volume. Uniaxial tensile tests are performed on living precision-cut rat lung slices.
Image registration is used to compute the displacement field at the surface of the sample.
The constitutive model consists of a hyperelastic potential split into volumetric and
isochoric contributions and a viscous contribution. This allows for the description of the
experimentally observed hysteresis loop. The identification is performed numerically: each
test is simulated using the realistic geometry of the sample; the difference between the
measured and computed displacements is minimized with an optimizational gorithm. We
compare several hyperelastic potentials and we can determine the most suitable law for
rat lung parenchyma. An exponential potential or a polynomial potential with a first order
term and a third or higher order term give similarly satisfactory results. The identified
parameters are: for the volumetric contribution: κ=7.25e4Pa, for the exponential form:
k1=4.34e3 Pa, k2=5.92, for the polynomial form: C1=2.87e3Pa, C3=3.83e4 Pa. The identi-
fication of the time parameter for the viscous contribution shows that it depends on the
loading frequency (0.2Hz: τ=0.257 s, 0.4Hz: τ=0.123 s, 0.8Hz: τ=0.050 s). Adding a viscous
contribution significantly increases the accuracy of the identification.",

directly interacting with the atomic nucleus rather than being scattered by the atomic shell.
Neutron Computed Tomography was tested in rats and allowed differentiation of larger lung
structures (e.g., lobes) and distal airways. Airways could be identified reliably down to the 6th
bronchial generation, in some cases even down to the 10th generation. The lung could be
stabilized for sufficiently long exposure times to achieve an image resolution of 50 -- 60 μm,

Instabilities which were reported for such problems in the literature are resolved by the present approach without requiring the additional consideration of a Lagrange multiplier technique. The suitability of the approach is demonstrated for two respiratory flow examples, a rather simple tube and complex tracheobronchial airways (up to the fourth generation, segmented from end-expiratory CT images). For the latter example, the boundary conditions are generated from mechanical ventilation data obtained from an intensive care unit patient suffering from acute lung injury.

The residual-based variational multiscale method with time-dependent (dynamic) subgrid scales is presented, and the impact of the time dependency is studied for the well-known test case of turbulent channel flow. Results are presented from computations for various values of the Reynolds number, namely Ret =180; Ret=395 and Ret=590, and several time-step sizes. A generalized-a time-integration scheme is employed. Results from our numerical experiments with dynamic subgrid scales are compared to results obtained with an approximation not explicitly taking the time-dependency of the subgrid scales into account. For all Re t-values and time-step sizes under consideration, results for resolved quantities computed by both approaches are very similar. This statement applies to both, mean streamwise velocity and root-mean-square velocity fluctuations. However, it provides a model for the subgrid-scales not depend- ing on the time-step size and enabling a more robust representation of unresolved scales. Thus we conclude that the time-dependent subgrid-scale approximation is not capable of producing more accurate results for this type of flow if the time-step size is chosen within an optimal range. However, we expect it to be more advantageous for more complex problems, since our results indicate that it provides a more reliable representation of unresolved scales.",

To account for transient effects, a dynamic simulation on the macro-scale is locally coupled to a quasi-static simulation of the discretized micro-level. For time integration, the generalized-ff scheme is employed on both scales. The presented algorithm is applicable for large deformations, rotations and arbitrary micro-structural behavior. On the macro-level, no constitutive assumption is required since the stress-strain relationship is directly computed from the micro-scale using established computational homogenization procedures.

Thus, for scale separation, no additional discretization besides the basic one is required, in contrast to earlier approaches based on geometric multigrid methods.

Thus, a multiscale modeling of the arterial network is a necessity. The multiscale approach is achieved through, first, modeling the arterial regions of interst with 3D models and the rest of the circulatory network with reduced-dimensional (reduced-D) models, then coupling the multiscale domains together. Though reduced-D models can well reproduce physiology, calibrating them to fit 3D patient-specific Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) geometries has received little attention. For this reason, this work develops calibration methods for reduced-D models using adjoint based methods.

flow dynamics of the upper and lower pulmonary airways up to generation 7 and carefully investigated
for this important application. Among other things, the results obtained with the proposed method are
compared to results obtained with a rather traditional stabilised finite element method. As opposed to
previous large-eddy simulations of pulmonary airways, we consider a pulsatile inflow condition, allowing the
development of turbulence over a pulse cycle to be investigated, which obviously makes these results more
physiologically realistic. Our results suggest that turbulent effects in the bronchial airways are rather weak
and can completely decay as early as the third generation, depending on geometry and flow distribution. Both methods utilised in this study are able to adequately capture all flow stages from laminar via transitional to turbulent regimes without any modifications. However, the algebraic variational multiscale-multigrid method provides superior results as soon as the flow enters the most challenging, turbulent flow regime. Furthermore, the robustness of the scale-separation approach based on plain aggregation algebraic multigrid inherent to the algebraic variational multiscale-multigrid method is demonstrated for the present complex geometry.",

  abstract = "The numerical discretization of thin shell structures yields ill-conditioned stiffness matrices due to an inherent large eigenvalue spectrum. Finite element parametrization that depends on shell thickness, like relative displacement shells, solid shells and other solid finite elements even add to the ill-conditioning by introducing high eigenmodes. To overcome this numerical issue we present a scaled thickness conditioning (STC) approach, a mechanically motivated preconditioner for thin-walled structures discretized with continuum based element formulations. The proposed approach is motivated by the scaled director conditioning (SDC) method for relative displacement shell elements. In contrast to SDC, the novel STC approach yields a preconditioner for the effective linear system. It is applicable independently of element technology employed, coupling to other physical fields, boundary conditions applied and additional algebraic constraints and can be easily extended to multilayer shell formulations. The effect of the proposed preconditioner on the conditioning of the effective stiffness matrix and its eigenvalue spectrum is studied. It is shown that the condition number of the modified system becomes almost independent from the aspect ratio of the employed elements. The improved conditioning has a positive influence on the convergence behavior of iterative linear solvers. In particular, in combination with algebraic multigrid preconditioners the number of iterations could be decreased by more than 85% for some examples and the computation time could be reduced by about 60%.",

  abstract = "In this study, a new method for the weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions in convection-dominated convection-diffusion and wall-bounded turbulent flow problems is developed. It is based on an embedded Dirichlet formulation which utilises an additional discontinuous stress field for imposing boundary conditions.
Values at outflow boundaries may not be sufficiently controllable on underresolved meshes, e.g., when using Nitsche’s method for weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions. Hence, a consistent modification of an earlier-proposed constantparameter embedded Dirichlet formulation that allows to regain control if required is introduced. A separate treatment of boundary conditions in wall-normal and tangential direction is enabled. This split is physically motivated, and it turns out to be crucial for a successful application of the method. On the one hand, it allows for including a formulation based on the law of the wall in tangential direction. On the other hand, a consistent modification derived from theoretical onsiderations for convection-diffusion problems is applied in wall-normal direction, preventing unphysical penetration of walls. Numerical results obtained for turbulent channel flow at modest friction Reynolds number Reτ = 395 employing meshes with and without adequate resolution of the boundary layer are presented. Superior performance of the proposed method compared to strongly-imposed boundary conditions is demonstrated by an error reduction of up to fifty percent for mean velocity results in the
core of the channel on coarse discretisations.",

In the multifractal subgrid-scale modeling approach, the subgrid-scale velocity is evaluated from a multifractal description of the subgrid-scale vorticity, which is based on the multifractal scale similarity of gradient fields in turbulent flow. The multifractal subgrid-scale modeling approach is integrated into a variational multiscale formulation, which constitutes a new application of the variational multiscale concept. A focus of this study is on the application of themultifractal subgrid-scalemodeling approach to wall-bounded turbulent flow. Therefore, a near-wall limit of themultifractal subgrid-scalemodeling approach is derived in this work. The novel computational approach of multifractal subgrid-scale modeling within a variational multiscale formulation is applied to turbulent channel flow at two different Reynolds numbers, turbulent flow over a backward-facing step and turbulent flow past a square-section cylinder, which are three of the most important and widely-used benchmark examples for wall-bounded turbulent flow. All results presented in this study confirm a very good performance of the proposed method. Compared to a dynamic Smagorinsky model and a residual-based variational multiscale method, improved results are obtained.

Large differences in the dimensions of the sclera, the principal load-bearing tissue of the eye, have been observed between individuals. This study aimed to characterize the effects of these differences on ONH biomechanics. Eleven enucleated human globes (7 normal and 4 ostensibly glaucomatous) were imaged using high-field microMRI and segmented to produce 3-D individual-specific corneoscleral shells. An identical, idealized ONH geometry was inserted into each shell. Finite element modeling predicted the effects of pressurizing the eyes to an IOP of 30 mmHg, with the results used to characterize the effect of inter-individual differences in scleral dimensions on the biomechanics of the ONH. Measurements of the individual-specific corneoscleral shells were used to construct a 2-D axisymmetric idealized model of the corneoscleral shell and ONH. A sensitivity analysis based on this model quantified the relative importance of different geometrical characteristics of the scleral shell on the biomechanics of the ONH. Significant variations were observed in various measures of strain in the idealized lamina cribrosa (LC) across the seven normal corneoscleral shells, implying large differences in individual biomechanics due to scleral anatomy variations alone. The sensitivity analysis revealed that scleral thickness adjacent to the ONH was responsible for the vast majority of variation. Remarkably, varying peripapilary scleral thickness over the physiologically measured range changed the peak (95th percentile) first principal strain in the LC and radial displacement of the ONH canal by an amount that was equivalent to a change in IOP of 15 mmHg. Inter-individual variations in scleral thickness, particularly peripapillary scleral thickness, can result in vastly different biomechanical responses to IOP. These differences may be significant for understanding the interactions between IOP and scleral biomechanics in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The relationship between scleral thickness and material properties needs to be studied in human eyes.",

This is for example the case in complex fluid-structure interaction problems when stateof- the-art boundary layer meshing is essential. This paper explores two enhancements of fixed-grid methods that allow the improved solution of such complex fluid-structure interaction problems. The two enhancements are: a straightforward approach based on local adaptivity and a hybrid method that combines ideas from fixed-grid methods and Arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerian formulations. Although both enhancements could be used with most available fixed-grid approaches they are given here against the background of a recently developed eXtended Finite Element Method/Lagrange Multiplier [11] fixed-grid method. It is shown that the hybrid scheme perfectly fits into the presented XFEM/LM framework in a consistent way.",

The results obtained from this test case show that both methods are capable of accurately predicting the features expected during the progression of the flame-vortex interaction.

To this end, we interpret preferred fiber reinforcement as the solution to a weighted optimization problem having two competing targets, minimal pulse pressure and minimal material usage, under the constraint of mechanical stability against buckling in a physiologically reasonable range of blood pressures. We demonstrate that the solution to this optimization problem for large arteries is a helical reinforcement with fibers oriented diagonally and for small arteries and veins an orthogonal reinforcement consisting of axial and circumferential fibers. Both findings agree well with experimental data reported by others, which suggests the existence of an underlying mechanical principle for the establishment and maintenance of vascular fiber orientations under normal conditions.

The eXtendend Finite Element Method (XFEM) is able to represent discontinuities sharply on fixed arbitrary meshes, but numerical difficulties arise if these discontinuities move in time. We point out that this issue is crucial for interface problems with strongly discontinuous fields on fixed grids. A method using semi-Lagrangean techniques is proposed to adequately handle time integration based on finite difference schemes in the context of the XFEM. The basic idea is to adapt previous numerical solutions to the current interface position by tracking back virtual Lagrangean particles to their previous positions, where an appropriate solution can be extrapo- lated from a smooth field. Convergence properties of the proposed method in time and space are thoroughly studied for two one-dimensional model problems. Finally, the method is applied to the particularly challenging problem of premixed combustion, where the discontinuity appears at the flame front separating the burnt from the unburnt gases. A two-dimensional and a three-dimensional expanding flame demonstrates that the method is sufficiently accurate to retain the properties of the overall Nitsche-type formulation for interface problems with embedded strong discontinuities.",

  abstract = "Networks of crosslinked biopolymer filaments such as the cytoskeleton are the subject of intense research. Oftentimes, mechanics on the scale of single monomers (~5 nm) govern the mechanics of the entire network (~10 μm). Until now, one either resolved the small scales and lost the big (network) picture or focused on mechanics above the single-filament scale and neglected the molecular architecture. Therefore, the study of network mechanics influenced by the entire spectrum of relevant length scales has been infeasible so far. We propose a method that reconciles both small and large length scales without the otherwise inevitable loss in either numerical efficiency or geometrical (molecular) detail. Both explicitly modeled species, filaments and their crosslinkers, are discretized with geometrically exact beam finite elements of Simo--Reissner type. Through specific coupling conditions between the elements of the two species, mechanical joints can be established anywhere along a beam's centerline, enabling arbitrary densities of chemical binding sites. These binding sites can be oriented to model the monomeric architecture of polymers. First, we carefully discuss the method and then demonstrate its capabilities by means of a series of numerical examples.",

by electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and the magnitude of regional ventilation, a key towards understanding lung mechanics and developing novel protective ventilation strategies. Two rat-derived three-dimensional alveolar
microstructures obtained from synchrotron-based X-ray tomography are each exposed to a constant potential difference for different states of ventilation in a finite element simulation. While the alveolar wall volume remains constant
during stretch, the enclosed air volume varies, similar to the lung volume during ventilation. The enclosed air, serving as insulator in the alveolar ensemble, determines the resulting current and accordingly local tissue bioimpedance.
From this we can derive a relationship between lung tissue bioimpedance and regional alveolar ventilation. The derived relationship shows linear dependency between air content and tissue impedance and matches clinical data determined from a ventilated patient at bedside.",

flow into and from homogenised solid domains. The proposed algorithm is
particularly interesting for investigations in the field of respiratory mechanics
as it enables the mutual coupling of airflow in the conducting part and local
tissue deformation in the respiratory part of the lung by means of a volume

interaction approach, a comprehensive model of the human respiratory system
can be established that enables clinically relevant investigations, e.g.,
of ventilator-associated lung injury in an efficient manner. To illustrate the
validity and versatility of the novel approach, three numerical examples including
a patient-specific lung model are presented. The proposed algorithm
proves its capability of computing clinically relevant airflow distribution and
tissue strain data at a level of detail that is not yet achievable, neither with

  abstract = "Agile Earth observation satellite missions are becoming more and more important due to their capability to perform
fast reorientation maneuvers with 3 degrees of freedom to capture different target areas along the orbital path, thus
increasing the observed area and complexity of scans. The design of an agile Earth observation satellite mission
is a non-trivial task due to the fact that a trade-off between observed area and complexity of the scans on the one
hand and degree of agility available and thus performance of the attitude control devices on the other hand has to be
done. Additionally, the designed mission has to be evaluated in a realistic environment also taking into account the
specific characteristics of the chosen actuators. In the present work, several methods are combined to provide an
integrated analysis of agile Earth observation satellite missions starting from the definition of a desired ground scan
scenario, going via the creation of a guidance profile to a realistic simulation and ending at the verification of the
feasibility by detailed closed-loop simulation. Regarding its technical implementation at Astrium GmbH, well-proven
tools for the different tasks of the analysis are incorporated and well defined interfaces for those tools are specified,
allowing a high degree of automatism and thus saving time and minimizing errors. This results in a complete endto-

demonstrated by means of an example analysis using Control Moment Gyros for a high agility mission.",

In this approach, a volume-averaged nodal projection operator is constructed to project the dilatational strain into an approximation space of equal- or lower-order than the approximation space for the displacement field resulting in a locking-free method. The stability of the method is provided via bubble-like basis functions. Because the notion of an ‘element’ or ‘cell’ is not present in the computation of the meshfree basis functions such low-order tessellations can be used regardless of the order of the approximation spaces desired. First- and second-order meshfree basis functions are chosen as a particular case in the proposed method. Numerical examples are provided in two and three dimensions to demonstrate the robustness of the method, its ability to avoid volumetric locking in the nearly-incompressible regime, and its improved performance when compared to the MINI finite element scheme on the simplicial mesh.",

In this approach, the level-set method, which allows for accurately representing complex interface evolutions, is combined with an extended finite element method for the fluid field. Sharp representation of the discontinuities at the interface related to surface-tension effects and large material-parameter ratios are
enabled by this approach. To capture the discontinuities, jump enrichments are applied for both velocity and pressure field. Nitsche’s method is then used to weakly impose the continuity of the velocity field. For a stable formulation on the entire domain, residual-based variational multiscale terms are supported by appropriate face-oriented ghost-penalty and fluid stabilization terms in the region of enriched elements.
Both face-oriented terms as well as interfacial terms related to Nitsche’s method are introduced such that it is accounted for viscous- and convection-dominated transient flows. As a result, stability and wellconditioned systems are guaranteed independent of the interface location. The proposed method is applied to four numerical examples of increasing complexity: two-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, a twodimensional
collapsing water column, three-dimensional rising bubbles as well as a three-dimensional bubble coalescence. Excellent agreement with either analytical solutions or numerical and experimental reference data as well as robustness for all flow regimes is demonstrated for all examples.",

  month = "Jan",
  abstract = "In the last few decades modeling deformation and flow in porous media has been of great interest due to its possible application areas in various fields of engineering such as biomechanics, soil mechanics, geophysics, physical chemistry and material sciences. Due to the high complexity and in most cases also unknown geometry of porous media on the microscale, a fully resolved model is nearly impossible to obtain, but most of the times also not necessary to answer important questions. As a consequence, one switches to a macroscopic approach. Such a mathematical description of porous media on the macroscale leads to a volumecoupled multi-field problem, wherein the interface between the two phases is not resolved explicitly. In this work we propose a
novel approach for modeling incompressible flow through a nearly incompressible elastic matrix under finite eformations. After a short overview of physical and mathematical fundamentals, the system equations are formulated and different representations are introduced and analyzed. Based on thermodynamic principles, a general constitutive law is derived, which allows the integration of arbitrary strain energy functions for the skeleton. Discretization in space with three primary variables and discretization in time using the one-step-theta method lead to a complete discrete formulation, which is the first one including both finite deformations as well as full coupling of structural and fluid phases. The suitability of the presented approach for modeling two-phase saturated poroelastic media is illustrated by several numerical examples.",

The aim of the study was to detect interrelations between mechanical conditions and material properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall with the underlying local gene expression of destabilising inflammatory, proteolytic, and structural factors.
Methods:
51 tissue samples from 31 AAA patients were harvested during open surgery. Gene expression of collagen I and III, inflammatory factors CD45, MSR1, and proteolytic MMP-2, -9, and their inhibitor TIMP-1 were analysed by RT-PCR. Material properties of corresponding AAA tissue samples were assessed by cyclic sinusoidal and destructive testing. Local mechanical conditions of stress and strain were determined by advanced nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) based on patient specific 3D AAA models derived from preoperative CT data.
Results:
 In the AAA wall, all histological parameters analysed were significantly expressed at mRNA level. With respect to mechanical properties of the aneurysmatic arterial wall, expression of collagen III correlated with the stiffness parameter α (r=-0.348, p=0.017), MMP-2 correlated with the stiffness parameter β and wall strength (r=-0.438 and -0.593; p=0.005 and <0.001). Furthermore, significant relationships were observed between local AAA diameter and the expression of CD45, MSR1, and TIMP-1 (r=0.285, 0.551, 0.328; p<0.05). However, we found no interrelation of local wall stresses and strains with gene expression.
Conclusion:
Our results show for the first time that gene expressions of destabilizing factors within AAA arterial tissue might be correlated to geometrical and mechanical properties of the AAA wall. However, we found no influence of local mechanical conditions on gene expression of these factors. Therefore, these preliminary results are still ambiguous.",

In the explicit scheme, the trace of the acoustic pressure is computed from the solution on the two elements adjacent to the face at the old time step. Tensor product shape functions for quadrilaterals and hexahedra evaluated with sum factorization are used to ensure low operation counts. For applying the inverse mass matrix of Lagrangian shape functions with full Gaussian quadrature, a new tensorial technique is proposed. As time propagators, diagonally implicit and explicit Runge--Kutta methods are used, respectively. We find that the computing time per time step is 25 to 200 times lower for the explicit scheme, with an increasing gap in three spatial dimensions and for higher element degrees. Our experiments on realistic 3D wave propagation with variable material parameters in a photoacoustic imaging setting show an improvement of two orders of magnitude in terms of time to solution, despite stability restrictions on the time step of the explicit scheme. Operation counts and a performance model to predict performance on other computer systems accompany our results.",

  abstract = "In simulation of cardiovascular processes and diseases patient-specific model parameters, such as constitutive properties, are usually not easy to obtain. Instead of using population mean values to perform "patient-specific" simulations, thereby neglecting the inter- and intra-patient variations present in these parameters, these uncertainties have to be considered in the computational assessment. However, due to limited computational resources and several shortcomings of traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, parametric uncertainties, modeled as random fields, have not yet been considered in patient-specific, nonlinear, large scale, and complex biomechanical applications. Hence, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, we present an uncertainty quantification framework based on multi fidelity sampling and Bayesian formulations. The key feature of the presented method is the ability to rigorously exploit and incorporate information from an approximate, low fidelity model. Most importantly, response statistics of the corresponding high fidelity model can be computed accurately even if the low fidelity model provides only a very poor approximation. The approach merely requires that the low fidelity model and the corresponding high fidelity model share a similar stochastic structure, i.e. dependence on the random input. This results in a tremendous exility in choice of the approximate model. The exibility and capabilities of the framework are demonstrated by performing uncertainty quantification using two patient-specific, large scale, nonlinear finite element models of abdominal aortic aneurysms. One constitutive parameter of the aneurysmatic arterial wall is modeled as a univariate three-dimensional, non-Gaussian random field, thereby taking into account inter- as well as intra-patient variations of this parameter. We use direct Monte Carlo to evaluate the proposed method and found excellent agreement with this reference solution. Additionally, the employed approach results in a tremendous reduction of computational costs, rendering uncertainty quantification with complex patientspecific nonlinear biomechanical models practical for the first time. Second, we also analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the input parameter on mechanical quantities typically related to abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture potential such as von Mises stress, von Mises strain and strain energy. Thus, providing first estimates on the variability of these mechanical quantities due to an uncertain constitutive parameter, and revealing the potential error made by assuming population averaged mean values in patient-specific simulations of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Moreover, the influence of correlation length of the random field is investigated in a parameter study using MC.",

The multiphase model is based on Thermodynamically Constrained Averaging Theory and comprises the extracellular matrix as a porous solid phase and three fluid phases: (living and necrotic) tumor cells, host cells and the interstitial fluid. Angiogenesis is modeled by treating the neovasculature as a proper additional phase with volume fraction or blood vessel density. This allows us to define consistent inter-phase exchange terms between the neovasculature and the interstitial fluid. As a consequence, transcapillary leakage and lymphatic drainage can be modeled. By including these important processes we are able to reproduce the increased interstitial pressure in tumors which is a crucial factor in drug delivery and, thus, therapeutic outcome. Different coupling schemes to solve the resulting five-phase problem are realized and compared with respect to robustness and computational efficiency. We find that a fully monolithic approach is superior to both the standard partitioned and a hybrid monolithic-partitioned scheme for a wide range of parameters. The flexible implementation of the novel model makes further extensions (e.g., inclusion of additional phases and species) straightforward.",

  abstract = "A novel approach to wall modeling for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations including flows of moderate and large Reynolds numbers is presented. The basic idea is that a problem-tailored function space allows prediction of turbulent boundary layer gradients with very coarse meshes. The proposed function space consists of a standard polynomial function space plus an enrichment, which is constructed using Spalding’s law-of-the-wall. The enrichment function is not enforced but ”allowed” in a consistent way and the overall methodology is much more general and also enables other enrichment functions. The proposed method is closely related to detached-eddy simulation as near-wall turbulence is modeled statistically and large eddies are resolved in the bulk flow. Interpreted in terms of a three- scale separation within the variational multiscale method, the standard scale resolves large eddies and the enrichment scale represents boundary layer turbulence in an averaged sense. The potential of the scheme is shown applying it to turbulent channel flow of friction Reynolds numbers from Reτ = 590 and up to 5, 000, flow over periodic constrictions at the Reynolds numbers ReH = 10, 595 and 19, 000 as well as backward-facing step flow at Reh = 5, 000,  all with extremely coarse meshes.

Especially compared to other meshfree methods, e.g. the moving least-squares method, it allows for a straightforward imposition of boundary conditions. However, no Eulerian approach has yet been presented for real incompressible flow, encountering the convective and pressure instabilities. In this paper, we exclusively address the pressure instabilities caused by the mixed velocity-pressure formulation of incompressible
Stokes flow. In a preparatory discussion, existing stable and stabilized methods are investigated and evaluated. This is used to develop different approaches towards a stable maximum-entropy formulation. We show results for two analytical tests, including a presentation of the convergence behaviour. As a typical benchmark problem, results are also shown for the leaky lid-driven cavity. Together with the information-flux method of [1] for convection-dominated problems, we see this as the last step towards a maximum-entropy method capable of simulating full incompressible flow problems.",

  abstract = "Ischemic placental disease is a concept that links intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE) back to insufficient remodeling of uterine spiral arteries. The rheological consequences of insufficient remodeling of uterine spiral arteries were hypothesized to mediate the considerably later manifestation of obstetric disease. However, the micro-rheology in the intervillous space (IVS) cannot be examined clinically and rheological animal models of the human IVS do not exist. Thus, an in silico approach was implemented to provide in vivo inaccessible data. The morphology of a spiral artery and the inflow region of the IVS were three-dimensionally reconstructed to provide a morphological stage for the simulations. Advanced high-end supercomputing resources were used to provide blood flow simulations at high spatial resolution. Our simulations revealed turbulent blood flow (high-velocity jets and vortices) combined with elevated blood pressure in the IVS and increased wall shear stress at the villous surface in conjunction with insufficient spiral artery remodeling only. Post-hoc histological analysis of uterine veins showed evidence of increased trophoblast shedding in an IUGR placenta. Our data support that rheological alteration in the IVS is a relevant mechanism linking ischemic placental disease to altered structural integrity and function of the placenta.",

Key to understand and to model ohmic losses in porous battery components are porosity as well as tortuosity. In the first part, we use impedance spectroscopy measurements in a new experimental setup to obtain the tortuosities and MacMullin numbers of some commonly separators, demonstrating experimental errors of < 8%. In the second part, we present impedance measurements of electrodes in symmetric cells using a blocking electrode configuration, which is obtained by using a non-intercalating electrolyte. The effective ionic resistivity of the electrode can be fit with a transmission-line model, allowing us to quantify the porosity dependent MacMullin numbers and tortuosities of electrodes with different active materials and different conductive carbon content. Best agreement between the transmission-line model and the impedance data is found when constant-phase elements rather than simple capacitors are used.",

    "description": "MeshPy is a general purpose 3D beam finite element input generator written in Python.
    It contains advanced geometry creation and manipulation functions to create complex beam geometries,
    including a consistent handling of finite rotations. MeshPy is especially developed for seamless
    integration with 4C.",
